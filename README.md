## Hi, I'm Juan

I find insights in data to reshape how we understand urban environments. My work focuses on using data science to solve complex urban challenges—uncovering patterns that drive smarter cities and more efficient systems.

Currently a researcher at Northeastern University, working on environmental monitoring and cloud infrastructure.

### How My Repos Are Organized

**`courses-*`** repositories are from courses I'm currently taking or course projects I found interesting enough to keep public.

**`utils-*`** repositories are simple scripts that come in handy at various moments—tools I like to have at hand just in case.

### Recent Projects

- **[cyclist-census](https://github.com/jcruz-ferreyra/cyclist-census)** - computer vision project comprising detection and classification tasks.
