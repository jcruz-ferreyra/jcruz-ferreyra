## Hi, I'm Juan

Data scientist specializing in transportation analytics. I build ML models and cloud infrastructure to solve real-world urban challenges.

Currently a researcher at Northeastern University, working on environmental monitoring and predictive modeling for urban systems.

### Currently Working On

- **Environmental Sensor Pipeline** - Real-time cloud infrastructure and dashboard for 50+ urban sensors monitoring temperature, humidity, and noise across Boston neighborhoods
- **Blue Bikes Demand Forecasting** - Time series analysis and operations research for predicting bike-share demand and optimizing rebalancing strategies
- **Cross-Modal Alignment Research** - Investigating how vision-language models learn semantic correspondence across architectural depths

### How My Repos Are Organized

**`courses-*`** repositories are from courses I'm currently taking or course projects I found interesting enough to keep public.

**`utils-*`** repositories are simple scripts that come in handy at various moments—tools I like to have at hand just in case.

### Recent Projects

- **[cyclist-census](https://github.com/jcruz-ferreyra/cyclist-census)** - Computer vision pipeline for analyzing urban cycling patterns from CCTV footage, combining object detection and demographic classification

- **[clip-layerwise-alignment](https://github.com/jcruz-ferreyra/clip-layerwise-alignment)** - Research pipeline investigating at which architectural depths cross-modal alignment emerges in vision-language models
